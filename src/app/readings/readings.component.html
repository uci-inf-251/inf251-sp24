   <h1>Readings</h1>
   <p>The assigned readings are on the <a href="./calendar">Calendar page</a>.</p>
   <p>The course structure and readings will be organized around specific areas of inquiry, following the <a href="https://chi2024.acm.org/subcommittees/selecting-a-subcommittee/">subcommittee organization of CHI</a>, the flagship publication venue for research on Human-Computer Interaction. The structure is by no means perfect, but it provides a useful backbone for organizing the field by key topics. For each area of inquiry we cover, we will spend one class session understanding the area's core topics, methods, and related academic disciplines. In the following class session, we will then discuss a few recent papers to better understand how those concepts are used in the kinds of contributions you might make if you were to conduct your own HCI research.</p>
		<p>Assigned readings will consisting of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><em>Calls for papers</em> from the CHI subcommittee and other related publication venues.</li>
			<li><em>Framing papers</em> which introduce a concept, approach, or topic that is commonly used in research of that subcommittee.</li>
			<li>Papers that provide <em>more recent contributions</em>, which we will use of examples to better understand the concepts, approaches, or topics.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Call for papers and framing papers will typically be assigned on "overview" days, and recent contributions on "discussion" days. The calendar will link to assigned readings and provide any day-specific revisions to this reading structure. You are expected to have read and considered the assigned readings prior to class, as the in-class discussions are a critical component of this course.</p>
		<p>The goal of these readings is to get an overview of and an appreciation for the style of work on this topic, rather than to understand the ins and outs of the arguments or calls. It is therefore expected that you will focus your examination on the more important aspects of each reading. Unless it interests you, you do not need to read the formatting expectations or deadline structure of a particular publication venue. Nor do you need to deeply examine the details of the methods of an empirical paper, only to understand the type(s) of methods used.</p>
		<p>Many of the framing readings are "Old". This is intentional, as they often help set up an agenda that the research field has since acted on. Or, they provide empirical evidence or discussion points that have become foundational to the way that we think about a particular research topic. But as a result of being "Old", they may include things that we now consider anything from obvious to antequated to insensitive. Papers may reference outdated devices like Palm Pilots, or reflect on the wonder that is Social Media. Papers may come across as reinforcing heteronormativity, or implicitly or explicitly exclude different user groups. Papers may have been led by corporations or other entities which since have been rightfully criticized for their practices. While we will leave a bit of space in this course to discuss how things have changed, we will make more progress on understanding how today's HCI research is conducted by primarily focusing on what still is relevant from these readings rather than what isn't.</p>
		<h2>Reading reports</h2>
		<p>To help prepare for an engaging and meaningful discussion, we require posting a few thoughts or questions beforehand. You can start a new discussion, participate in an existing discussion, or a bit of both. You can discuss all of the assigned readings, or focus on a portion of a reading that you thought was worth discussing further. Importantly, these reports are <em>not intended to be paper summaries</em>. Instead, they are intended to be critical reflections of the contributions or arguments made by the papers.</p>
		<p>We will use <a href="https://app.perusall.com/courses/in4matx-232-spring-2023">Perusall</a> for discussion, as past offerings have suggested that it supports questions and answers in-context with the reading text.</p>
		<!--
		<p>For example, you might answer:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What non-HCI disciplines does this work draw inspiration from or build on? Why does this work benefit from building on those disciplines?</li>
			<li>What of the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2907069">typical HCI research contributions</a> is this does the paper make? Why is that choice of contribution appropriate for the intended research question?</li>
			<li>What are examples of more recent publications, articles, or products which draw on the principles outlined in this work? How do they build on those principles?</li>
		</ul>
		-->
		<p>Reading reports can be short, a paragraph is fine. Your participation in the discussion for each day will be graded on a binary scale (0-1), based on timely participation or not.</p>
		<p>Reading reports are due at 11:59pm the night before each class meeting. This ensures time the next day to review discussion before class. Submitting the day of class, just before class, or in class is therefore unacceptable, risking zero credit. But feel free to continue a discussion after this, even after class.</p>
		<h2>Leading discussion</h2>
		<p>You will lead the discussion for one subcommittee during the quarter, in groups of roughly three. Your group will lead discussion on both the "Overview" and the "Discussion" days. On "Overview" day, your group should prepare a presentation which answers:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What are the core research questions or topics examined by researchers tho publish in this subcommittee?</li>
			<li>Outside of HCI, what disciplines do contributions on this topic seem to draw from?</li>
			<li>Based on the calls for papers from the CHI subcommittee and other related venues, how are these venues similar and different in the kinds of research contributions they publish? What kinds of research questions seem in-scope at one venue, but out-of-scope at another?</li>
			<li>What is this subcommittee's history at CHI? This will require looking at the subcommittees and calls for papers from prior CHI conferences. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_on_Human_Factors_in_Computing_Systems">Wikipedia</a> has links to list of past CHI websites, with subcommittees first appearing in 2009. For example, you might answer:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>How long has this area been its own a subcommittee?</li>
				<li>Was this work represented by a different subcommittee at CHI prior to becoming a dedicated subcommitee?</li>
				<li>How, if at all, has the subcommittee's description of what makes a contribution changed over time?</li>
			</ul>
			<li>What do the framing papers suggest are core sub-topics within the subcommittee? Or typical methodological approaches to doing research? Or theoretical perspectives of that subcommittee for doing research? The framing papers might cover one or more of these points, aim to incorporate discussion of what feels relevant about those papers to the subcommittee into your presentation.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For "Discussion" day, your group should select two recent papers (from the past 2 years) which exemplify the area. Papers do not need to be from CHI specifically, but must be from one of the venues where we read the call for papers. The <a href="https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2023/index/sessions/type/12529">paper sessions</a> from the most recent CHI conference are a good place to start, for example by selecting papers which were recognized with <a href="https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2023/index/sessions/type/12529">Best Paper or Honorable Mention awards</a> (though papers which did not win awards are also fine). Daniel can also offer some suggestions. To give ample time for your classmates to read, please send these to Daniel a week ahead of class.</p>
		<p>Prepare a presentation which provides some background on the contribution of each paper. All of your classmates will have read the papers, so do not simply present a summary of the paper. Instead, your presentation should answer:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How does each paper argue that its topic is worthy of study?</li>
			<li>What areas of inquiry within HCI and outside of does each paper draw from? How does the paper expand on those areas to make its contribution?</li>
			<li>What of the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2907069">typical HCI research contributions</a> is this paper making? Why was this contribution appropriate for the paper?</li>
			<li>What are the main takeaways of each paper for the HCI research community? What, if any, are the main takeaways of each paper to other research communities?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For calibration, we expect it will take groups a few hours to prepare these presentations. Daniel is happy to chat with your group ahead of your discussion week. We then expect presentations will be the majority of the class period on "overview" days, and a little shorter on "discussion" days. The expectation is that presentations will be frequently interrupted with questions or additional thoughts from Daniel and your classmates. Therefore, aim to provide a thorough background on the readings and venues, but avoid the temptation to pad the presentation to fill the allocated time. As part of preparation, the presenter should share any additional resources or slides they create with Daniel to pust on the class website.</p>
		<p>It may be tempting to split discussion leading duties, where some group members take charge of "Overview" day and others "Discussion" day. However, we suggest working on both as a full group, as shared understanding of the area is necessary.</p>
		<p>Daniel has more of a background in some of these areas of inquiry than others. It's likely that some of you have a deeper understanding of some of these areas than he does. Feel free to recommend additional or alternative framing readings, venues, etc.</p>
