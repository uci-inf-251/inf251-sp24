   <h1>Readings</h1>
   <p>The assigned readings are on the <a href="./calendar">Calendar page</a>.</p>
	<p>Many of the framing readings are "Old". This is intentional, as they often help set up an agenda that the research field has since acted on. Or, they provide empirical evidence or discussion points that have become foundational to the way that we think about a particular research topic. But as a result of being "Old", they may include things that we now consider anything from obvious to antequated to insensitive. Papers may come across as reinforcing heteronormativity, or implicitly or explicitly exclude different user groups. Papers may have been led by corporations or other entities which since have been rightfully criticized for their practices.</p>
	<h2>Reading reports</h2>
	<p>To help prepare for an engaging and meaningful discussion, we require posting a few thoughts or questions beforehand. You can start a new discussion, participate in an existing discussion, or a bit of both. You can discuss all of the assigned readings, or focus on a portion of a reading that you thought was worth discussing further. Importantly, these reports are <em>not intended to be paper summaries</em>. Instead, they are intended to be critical reflections of the contributions or arguments made by the papers.</p>
	<p>We will use <a href="https://app.perusall.com/courses/in4matx-251-cscw/">Perusall</a> for discussion, as it supports questions and answers in-context with the reading text.</p>
	<p>Reading reports can be short, a few sentences are fine. Your participation in the discussion for each day will be graded on a binary scale (0-1), based on timely participation or not.</p>
	<p>Reading reports are due at 11:59pm the night before each class meeting. This ensures time the next day to review discussion before class. Submitting the day of class, just before class, or in class is therefore unacceptable, risking zero credit. But feel free to continue a discussion after this, even after class.</p>
	<h2>Leading discussion</h2>
	<p>You will lead the discussion once or twice during the quarter. Come prepared with discussion questions for the class. Focus on the implications of the papers, and larger questions about social technologies that the papers invite, rather than the ins and outs of their methodological choices and specific contexts.</p>
	<p>For calibration, we expect it will take a few hours to prepare these presentations and the resulting discussion. Daniel is happy to chat ahead of your discussion leading. The expectation is that presentations will be frequently interrupted with questions or additional thoughts from Daniel and your classmates. Therefore, aim to provide a thorough background on the readings and venues, but avoid the temptation to pad the presentation to fill the allocated time. As part of preparation, the presenter can share any additional resources or slides they create with Daniel to put on the class website.</p>
	<p>Daniel has more of a background in some of these areas of inquiry than others. It's likely that some of you have a deeper understanding of some of these areas than he does. Feel free to recommend additional or alternative readings.</p>
